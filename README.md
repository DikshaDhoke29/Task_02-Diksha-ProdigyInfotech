Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.
Pixel Manipulation is the process of directly altering individual pixels in a digital image to achieve various effects. This involves accessing and modifying the color values of each pixel, which are typically represented as Red, Green, Blue (RGB).
Image encryption is a process that transforms an image into an unreadable or scrambled format to prevent unauthorized access. It hides the original visual content of an image so that only someone with the correct key or method can recover (decrypt) it.

It is a special application of cryptography used to protect visual data such as photos, fingerprints, scanned documents, satellite images, etc.
